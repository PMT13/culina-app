## Key Features

**Describe the most challenging features you implemented
(one sentence per bullet, maximum 4 bullets):**

* the grocery list builder required a two-way link between all recipes and the ingredients on them, which was quite difficult to set up and maintain, especially with all the edge cases of the various ways to update and delete ingredients from a recipe
* the app allows the users to select and seperate the quantifiers and the ingredients by selectively highlight the latter when importing an online recipe

Which (if any) device integration(s) does your app support?

* A device integration that our app supports is uploading an image from users device or using the camera on the users device to upload an image.

Which (if any) progressive web app feature(s) does your app support?

* N/A

## Testing Notes

**Is there anything special we need to know in order to effectively test your app? (optional):**

* Our amount of free api requests is limited (we have used around 25 out of 100 free requests) so please take that into consideration when testing our online recipe importation.

* Capturing an image on an IPhone only works on Safari.
